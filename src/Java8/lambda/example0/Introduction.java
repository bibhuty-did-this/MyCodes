/**
 * Why lambda ?
 *  + Enables functional programming
 *  + Readable and concise code
 *  + Easier-to-use API and libraries
 *  + Enables support for parallel processing

/**
 * Functional vs Object-oriented Programming:
 *  + Helps to write small, elegant and readable code in certain situations
 */

/**
 * Problems in OOPs in Java:
 *  + Everything is an object
 *  + All code blocks are "associated" with classes and objects(no function in isolation
 *    for saying "Hello" let's say)
 */

/**
 * Functional Interface:
 *  + An interface having only one abstract method is called functional interface.
 *  + It could have many methods with default implementation but it needs to have
 *    only one abstract interface.
