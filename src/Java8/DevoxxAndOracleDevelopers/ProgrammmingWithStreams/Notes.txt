What does streams do for us ?
    1. separates what from how
    2. functional in nature
    3. focus on whole instead of parts

What is stream ?
    1. It is not a data structure
    2. It is a higher level of abstraction of a classic for loop
       (without fiddling with the minute details as forEach loop)
    3. It is non-mutating
       (not modifying a collection when inside a stream)
    4. A view of how data is transformed
    5. A pipeline

How to use streams ?
    1. Raise from concrete(collection, as they are initialized, populated etc.) to stream
    2. Ride the stream
    3. Compose operation

Streams employ function composition

Stateless behaviour

Pure functions

Specialized functions:
    - filter
    - map
    - reduce
      (often is going to result in a single point which may be a value or collection itself,
       brings you back to the concrete operation unlike above)
        - general reduce
        - specialized
            - sum
            - max
            - min
            - count

Characteristics: sized, ordered, distinct, sorted
    - depends on source
    - depends on operation

Raise, Operate and Land(pattern of operation in streams)

Use care landing

Important operations:
    - set
    - map
    - grouping by

Sorting with comparator
    - sorted with comparator
    - comparing
    - thenComparing

Efficiency ?

Intermediate vs Terminal Operation

Fuzing and lazy evaluation

Infinite streams
    - Short-circuiting intermediate and terminal operations

Parallel streams
