- Parallel vs Asynchronous:
    + nature of problem
    + when to use parallel/concurrently(fork, then join the continue)
    + when to use asynchronous

- Parallel Stream:
    + collection pipeline pattern
    + from imperative to functional
    + benefits of pipeline pattern
    + parallel as a master switch
    + sequential execution
    + stream to parallel stream
    + observing threads
    + order of execution
    + controlling the order(only possible when the stream is ordered)
    + parallel and filter
    + parallel and map
    + parallel and reduce
    + using parallel stream
        ~ on an IO problem
        ~ on a computational problem
    + How many threads?
    + Formula to decide number of threads
    + Default number of threads(#cores in machine)
    + Configure number of threads JVM wide(not recommended)
        -D java.util.Concurrent.ForkJoinPool.common.parallelism=100
    + Configuring programmatically number of threads
    + Parallel doesn't always mean fast
        - How to decide whether to make parallel
    + When parallel make no sense

- CompletableFutures:
    + Asynchronous execution(non-blocking)
    + Drawbacks of Future
    + Lessons from Javascript
    + Callbacks
        ~ lacks consistency(if the callback is data or error)
        ~ hard to compose(callback hell problem)
        ~ hard to deal with errors
    + Promises
        ~ may resolve, reject or pending
        ~ data channel and error channel
        ~ failure/error is like data
        ~ easy to compose
    + What about Java?
    + CompletableFuture in Java is Promises in Javascript
    + Stages
    + One stage completes and another stage may run
    + Creating a completable future
