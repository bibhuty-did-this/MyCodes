- Parallel vs Asynchronous:
    + nature of problem
    + when to use parallel/concurrently(fork, then join the continue)
    + when to use asynchronous

- Parallel Stream:
    + collection pipeline pattern
    + from imperative to functional
    + benefits of pipeline pattern
    + parallel as a master switch
    + sequential execution
    + stream to parallel stream
    + observing threads
    + order of execution
    + controlling the order(only possible when the stream is ordered)
    + parallel and filter
    + parallel and map
    + parallel and reduce
    + using parallel stream
        ~ on an IO problem
        ~ on a computational problem
    + How many threads?
    + Formula to decide number of threads
    + Default number of threads
