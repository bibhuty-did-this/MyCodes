/**
 * Heap:
 *  + A Heap is a special tree based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree
 *  + There are 2 types of heaps:
 *      ~ Max-Heap: In a Max-Heap the key present at the root node must be greatest among all the keys
 *                  present at all of it's children. The same property must be recursively true for
 *                  all sub-trees in that tree.
 *      ~ Min-Heap: In a Min-Heap the key present at the root nod must be minimum among all the keys
 *                  present at all of it's children. The same property must be recursively true for
 *                  all sub-trees in that tree.
