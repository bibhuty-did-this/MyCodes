    /**
     * + Java technology is both a programming language and a platform.
     *
     * + The Java programming language is a high-level language that can be
     * characterized by all of the following buzzwords:
     *      - Simple
     *      - Object oriented
     *      - Distributed
     *      - Multithreaded
     *      - Dynamic
     *      - Architecture neutral
     *      - Portable
     *      - High performance
     *      - Robust
     *      - Secure
     *
     * + The Java platform has two components:
     *      - The Java Virtual Machine
     *      - The Java Application Programming Interface (API)
     *
     * + As a platform-independent environment, the Java platform can be a bit slower
     *   than native code. However, advances in compiler and virtual machine technologies
     *   are bringing performance close to that of native code without threatening portability.
